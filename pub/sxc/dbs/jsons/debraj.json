{"cat":"UG Project","year":"2021","title":"Motion Video Analysis of Dynamical Systems Challenges and Solutions", "abstract":"The aim of the project is to develop a generalized sequence of steps that can extract the dynamics of a classical system. These steps are employed to obtain the position data from an experimental setup and then to fit the data to a set of modeled differential equations. A spherical pendulum and a magnetic pendulum is a non-linear system used for this purpose. The system is first modeled by a set of differential equations. The motion of the system is then captured using two cameras placed at different relative orientations with respect to the setup. The position data in subsequent video frames for the pair of un-synchronized cameras is reconstructed in 3D space using stereo geometry, triangulation and bundle  adjustment and the experimentally captured data set is fit to the predicted set of differential equations using non-linear least square fit. The data-set and the values of the fit parameters are then used to verify the extent to which the set of differential equations can model the physical system.", "supervisor":"Dr. Shibaji Banerjee","sup_photo":"ShibajiBanerjee.jpg","fl_nm":"127_DebrajDutta_HPHDS6043D.pdf","students":[{"name":"Debraj Dutta","ph":"debraj.jpg"},{"name":"Mousumi Mitra","ph":"mousumi.jpg"}]}
