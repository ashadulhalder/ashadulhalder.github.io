Referee Report:
--------------------

This manucript is devoted to the effects of violation of the equivalence
principle (VEP) in neutrino oscillations, which can induce an additional
phase of different energy and baseline dependence. In general this is an
interesting topic for possible new physics. But I think the current
manuscript is not suitable for publication in NPB, with the following
comments:

1) The framework used in this work is a 3(active) + 1(sterile) mixing in
the presence of VEP, but the mass-squared difference delta m^{2}_{41} is
taken as 10^{-3} eV^2, which is not well motivated from the point of view
of neutrino oscillation experiments. Additional delta m^{2}_{41} at
10^{-3} eV^2 must confront with the global neutrino oscillation data,
including the atmospheric neutrinos, reactor neutrinos and long baseline
accelerator neutrinos. There should be no indication for such a scenario.
Indications for light sterile neutrinos are only observed at short
baseline oscillations with  delta m^{2}_{41} at around 1 eV^2.

2) The analysis of this work itself is also incomplete. The authors only
discussed the new physics effects in the oscillation probability level,
and roughly calculated the total event numbers. No statistical analysis on
the sensitivity of such detector configurations is provided, which should
be a standard and central content for the similar phenomenological
studies.

In summary, with the above drawbacks I don't think this work meets the
standards of this journal.
