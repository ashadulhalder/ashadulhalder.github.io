Report of the Referee -- DD13001/Pandey
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am refereeing the paper by Pandey et al. “The Violation of
Equivalence Principle and Four Neutrino Oscillations for Long Baseline
Neutrinos”, where the authors study the situation when different types
of neutrinos are coupled to a gravitational field differently. The
impact of this fact on neutrino flavor oscillations is considered in
the case of (3+1) framework. This idea is interesting but its
technical implementation is incorrect. I cannot recommend this
manuscript for the publication in Physical Review D. My main objection
is the following.

1. The contribution of gravity to neutrino flavor oscillations in the
unnumbered equation between Eqs. (15) and (16) is incorrect. To get
it, the authors refer to Refs. [6,7]. However, the authors are
unfamiliar with multiple works, where neutrino flavor oscillations in
curved spacetime are studied. The solution of this problem involves
the analysis of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a neutrino mass
eigenstate in curved spacetime. The contribution of a static
gravitational field to the phase difference of oscillations turns out
to be ~ delta m^4/E^3. The authors may check, e.g., the recent work
arxiv:0906.5556 on this issue, where this problem is examined and the
comparison with previous studies is provided.

Minor comments are

2. On page 3, the authors claim that there is no phase shift of
oscillations in curved spacetime. It is the wrong statement as
explained above.

3. On page 7, the authors introduce “gravity eigenstates”. I did not
get what it is. However, on page 8, they equate the mixing angles,
theta_{ij} = theta’_{ij}. It means that “gravity eigenstates” are
identical to well known mass eigenstates. I explained in the item # 1
how to couple gravity to neutrino mass eigenstates.

4. I have one question on Sec. 3.2, where the authors study how the
modified gravity affects observations in a neutrino long baseline
experiment. What is the source of this gravitational field? Is it
created by the Earth? If so, the authors should take into account the
coordinate dependence of Delta f_{ij}. Indeed, the deeper a neutrino
is, the greater the gravitational potential is. I guess, the authors
assumed that Delta f_{ij} is constant in their work.

If the authors are willing to continue with this problem, they should
withdraw this manuscript, revise the contribution of gravity to
neutrino mass eigenstates and all the subsequent results, and resubmit
it as a new paper.
